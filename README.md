# Neural Networks And Deep Learning Course Project 1 (Coursera)
Built an image recognition algorithm. A cat classifier that recognizes cats using Logistic Regression with 70% accuracy!

Find complete code inside ipython notebook.
I had fun playing around with the dataset. Looking forward to working on similar projects in the future.
